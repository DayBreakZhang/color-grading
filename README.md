# LUT Creator (png type) for OBS and other



Using Color sampes from the local paint shop, I've created a Python script to create a color filter that can be turned into a LUT tool to correct colors in video recordings.  While not ideal for a final processed video/photo, it gets the footage to a standardized point that can be corrected with other LUTs that cannot be dyamically generated. This tool can create custom luts on demand; you just need the color reference card to start.

This tool can be run on Google Colab, so no Python setup or local operation is neede -- all in the cloud if desired. Check it out at the link above!
